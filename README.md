# How to analyse and visualise large sets of data on Python

## Summary 

We have a large dataset of containing information about energy generation of each technology for each country. As it stands, it is a bit of a mess and hard to gain valuable insight from it. However, this can be fixed with the help of excellent data science libraries on Python such as Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas. Therefore it is important to make sure to have those properly installed before running this project!

## Problems 

1) In table form, show the cumulative global capacity, broken down by technology and year (2013 to 2020), for all countries listed in the database.
2) Make a graph to show the evolution of the capacity mix in Portugal between 2013 and 2020.
3) Make a graph to show the total cumulative capacity, in Portugal,  grouped by technology between 2013 and 2020.
4) What is the capacity factor for coal in Portugal from 2013 to 2020? What might this say about power generation in Portugal?

## Additional information

1) Data can be found in data.xlsx file made available. Please familiarise yourself with this data in order to get a better feel of this project.
2) Capacity factor is the ratio of actual energy generated to the Rated energy capaciy.
3) There are many ways to do Problems 2 and 3, however for the sake of diversity I did a line graph for Problem 2 and a  stacked bar graph for Question 2.
